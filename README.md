Hey fellas.  I thought that we would get a little practice using Git and Github before the competition.  
I set up something that is super simple.  I recommend we use a method called Github Flow (http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html).

What you need to do is:

1.  Do not edit Main.java except to uncomment your function when it is done. 
2.  Write a function within Intro.java (match the function name to the function call I wrote in Main.java for you).
This function should return a String that has your name and two details about you (favorite color, interests, weird facts, I don't care).
